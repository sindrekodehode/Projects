          Bergen is surrounded by mountains and ocean. If you don't like either
          you could always get lost in some of the dense forest scattered
          around.
        </p>
        <p id="para2">
          The climate is usually both wet and cold and luckily the mountains
          tend to funnel the wind so it can get extra windy as well. Nothing
          like a fresh ocean breeze to freeze you to your very core.
        </p>
        <p id="para3">
          The people tend to be as open and welcoming as a clam. Once people get
          to know and trust you, they tend to be more open, but good luck
          getting people to know and trust you!

            Greetings stranger, come in out of the cold! I'm your friendly
            neighbourhood tourguide Mr. Crab. If you have any additional
            questions about Bergen, feel free to ask. There are no stupid
            questions here (except asking if it rains a lot). Hope you've had a
            pleasant stay here in Bergen and I hope to see you again soon!
